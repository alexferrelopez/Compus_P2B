# LSControl Tower

## Overview
LSControl Tower is a microcontroller-based system developed for digital systems and microprocessor applications. It allows users to communicate with a control tower via a **3x4 matrix keyboard**, select ports, interact through an **LCD display**, and record/playback audio using a **Java interface**.

This project was developed as part of the **Digital Systems and Microprocessors** coursework (2022-2023).

## Features
- **Keyboard Input**: Users input a port code using a **3x4 matrix keyboard**.
- **LCD Display Navigation**: Menu options are displayed and navigated using a **joystick**.
- **Audio Recording & Playback**: Audio samples are recorded via a **microphone**, transmitted via serial communication, and played back through a **Java interface**.
- **Time Display & Adjustment**: The system keeps track of elapsed time since communication start and allows time adjustments.

## Microcontroller Used
- **Microcontroller**: PIC18F4321
- **Architecture**: 8-bit
- **Flash Memory**: 32 KB
- **RAM**: 1 KB
- **EEPROM**: 256 Bytes
- **ADC Resolution**: 10-bit
- **USART Communication**: Supports serial transmission
- **Timers & PWM**: Used for system timing, scrolling effects, and speaker control

## System Components
### Hardware
- **PIC18F4321 Microcontroller**
- **3x4 Matrix Keyboard**

## Functional Overview
### 1. User Interaction
- The user selects a communication port using the **keyboard**.
- Menu navigation is performed using a **joystick**.
- Menu options may scroll using a **marquee effect** if text is too long.

### 2. Audio Recording & Playback
- Users can **record audio** with a microphone.
- Audio data is sampled and transmitted to the **Java interface**.
- Playback is initiated by selecting a recording from a list.

### 3. Time & System Functions
- The system maintains a **real-time clock**.
- Users can modify the system time.
- The elapsed time since communication start is displayed.
